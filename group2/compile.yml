# Cache Maven artifacts so we don't download the internet again
# Caches are scoped to a particular task name inside of a pipeline's job.


# We will provide an input called 'git' to this Task
# This causes Concourse to git checkout a specific commit.
# It also allows us to execute this step independently, for a specific Git commit.
# However, the parent pipeline only runs this task when the previous 'unit' job has passed.
inputs:
  - name: git1

outputs:
  - name: image # Concourse creates this directory for us. This will hold the OCI image .tar

# What do we want this task to do?
# Tell Concourse the commands it should execute, in this Task
# Build an OCI image as a .tar file. Skip unit tests, because we've already run them in the previous Job
#     mvn compile jib:buildTar ... -DskipTests
